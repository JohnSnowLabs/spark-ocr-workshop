\n\nAlien sex? Harvard prof believes it\n\nExperiences with extraterrestrial real, he says\n\nBy ANNE THOMPSON\nAssociated Press\n\nCAMBRIDGE, Mass. — Dr. John\nMack, a Harvard psychiatrist, has\nnever had sex with a space alien, nor\ndoes he care to. It could compromise\nhis objectivity.\n\nMack, a Pulitzer Prize winner,\nfirmly believes those people who say\nthey had extremely close encounters\nwith beings from other worlds.\n\nAnd in his new book, “Abduc-\ntion,” he relates his findings after\nspending four years studying 120\n“experiencers” — people who say\nthey had sexual or reproductive ex-\nperiences with aliens who abducted\nthem and took them aboard space-\nships.\n\nThe 13 case studies in his book\ninclude Ed, who remembers an alien\nwoman taking a sperm sample from\nhim when he was in high school;\nJerry, who says she gave birth to a\nhuman-alien hybrid; and Peter, who\ntells Mack he had an “alien wife” ina\n“parallel universe.”\n\n“There is a consistent reproduc-\ntive theme,” Mack said. “Now, do I\nmean by that literally there are mil-\nlions of babies being made? I don’t\nknow. I can’t claim that this is occur-\n\nring literally in our physical dimen-\nsion of reality.”\n\nWhat Mack does claim is that\nexperiencers are not mentally ill and\nare not working out the effects of\nrape, incest or other abuse. Their\nemotional and psychological state\nresembles trauma, he said, and trau-\nma is the response to something\noutside the body, not inside the mind.\n\n“They don’t want to believe it any\nmore than we do,” he said. “They\nwant me to find them crazy.”\n\nDescriptions of abductions are\nconsistent from patient to patient,\nMack said.

Harvard prof believes it\n\nExperiences with extraterrestrial real, he says\n\nBy ANNE THOMPSON\nAssociated Press\n\nCAMBRIDGE, Mass. — Dr. John\nMack, a Harvard psychiatrist, has\nnever had sex with a space alien, nor\ndoes he care to. It could compromise\nhis objectivity.\n\nMack, a Pulitzer Prize winner,\nfirmly believes those people who say\nthey had extremely close encounters\nwith beings from other worlds.\n\nAnd in his new book, “Abduc-\ntion,” he relates his findings after\nspending four years studying 120\n“experiencers” — people who say\nthey had sexual or reproductive ex-\nperiences with aliens who abducted\nthem and took them aboard space-\nships.\n\nThe 13 case studies in his book\ninclude Ed, who remembers an alien\nwoman taking a sperm sample from\nhim when he was in high school;\nJerry, who says she gave birth to a\nhuman-alien hybrid; and Peter, who\ntells Mack he had an “alien wife” ina\n“parallel universe.”\n\n“There is a consistent reproduc-\ntive theme,” Mack said. “Now, do I\nmean by that literally there are mil-\nlions of babies being made? I don’t\nknow. I can’t claim that this is occur-\n\nring literally in our physical dimen-\nsion of reality.”\n\nWhat Mack does claim is that\nexperiencers are not mentally ill and\nare not working out the effects of\nrape, incest or other abuse. Their\nemotional and psychological state\nresembles trauma, he said, and trau-\nma is the response to something\noutside the body, not inside the mind.\n\n“They don’t want to believe it any\nmore than we do,” he said. “They\nwant me to find them crazy.”\n\nDescriptions of abductions are\nconsistent from patient to patient,\nMack said. So he believes the exper-\niencers, even if he can’t explain\nexactly what they experienced.\n\nOne of Mack’s patients, a 37-year-\nold undercover debunker, told Time\nmagazine that Mack gave her UFO\nliterature to read before he hypno-\ntized her.\n\n“John made it obvious what he\nwanted to hear,” the patient, Donna\nBassett, said. “I provided the an-\nswers.””\n\nMack could not be located to\nrespond to Bassett’s allegations. He\ndeclined to comment to the magazine\nabout her case.\n\nHis accomplishments include\n\nfounding the psychiatry department\nat the Harvard-affiliated Cambridge\nHospital and winning a 1977 Pulitzer\nfor his psychoanalytic biography of\nT.E. Lawrence (Lawrence of Arabia).\n\nSince then, Mack has developed\nan interest in Eastern philosophy and\nreligion, and believes it helped liber-\nate his thinking.\n\n“We don’t have room in our cul-\nture for this. It’s the elite people, my\ncolleagues, who decide what we're\nsupposed to believe,” he said, “and to\nthem this isn’t supposed to be.”\n\nEven Mack’s fellow researchers\ninto the otherworldly think “‘Abduc-\ntion” is a little, well, out there.\n\nDr. William McCall, a physician in\nAnaheim, Calif., said that for 10 years\nhe used hypnosis to evaluate exper-\niencers.
